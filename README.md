# Splyntery
Author: Cody Keller<br>
Description: Splyntery is a python based application that enables its user to intelligently, and automatically, progress through the video game "Dead by Daylight"'s Bloodweb.<br><br>
NOTE:<br>
This application is a WIP... there are many features to come such as auto-perk & auto-addon selection, as well as the capability for Splyntery to automatically identify path progression regardless of whether or not you are using a custom icon pack.
